Using **Github**
To begin using Github and create a repository:
1. Go to Github.com and create and account
2. Verify your email address
3. Once signed in click on the plus on the top right and click new repository
4. Customize repository as needed and click Create Repository button, located at the bottom of the page
Using **Git** and VSCode together
Git is used for version control. It can be used on it's own, but I find it to be more useful when combined with an IDE to seamlessly make changes to a repository. 

Glossary:
Branch - a copy of a repository, stored in the original, but does not affect the original live repository. Can be merged with original once satisfied with changes.
Clone - a locally stored copy of a repository. Can be edited offline and when online, can push the changes from the locally stored to the original.
