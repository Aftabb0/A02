Using **Github**
To begin using Github and create a repository:
1. Go to Github.com and create and account
2. Verify your email address
3. Once signed in click on the plus on the top right and click new repository
4. Customize repository as needed and click Create Repository button, located at the bottom of the page

Using **Git** and VSCode together
Git is used for version control. It can be used on it's own, but I find it to be more useful when combined with an IDE to seamlessly make changes to a repository.
1. Download Git and Visual Studio Code. (https://git-scm.com/downloads)(https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Open up Visual Studio Code and look for the Source Control panel on the right.
3. Click into the Source Control panel and enter desired Git command
